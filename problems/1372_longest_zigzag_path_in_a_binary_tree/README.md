# LeetCode 1372 - Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree

## Problem  
- [LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-zigzag-path-in-a-binary-tree/)

## My Solution

### Code
- [solution.php](./solution.php)
- We use a recursive DFS function to explore all paths and track the longest zigzag path from each node.

### Time & Space Complexity
- Time  : $O(n)$
  - $n$ : the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- Space : $O(h)$
  - $h$ : the height of the binary tree.
