# LeetCode 62 - Unique Paths

## Problem  
- [LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

## My Solution

### Code
- [solution.php](./solution.php)
- We use a combinatorial approach instead of dynamic programming,
  as it allows us to compute the number of unique paths efficiently with constant space and faster execution.

### Time & Space Complexity
- Time  : $O(\min(m, n))$
- Space : $O(1)$
