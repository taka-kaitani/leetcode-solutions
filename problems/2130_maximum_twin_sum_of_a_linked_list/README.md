# LeetCode 2130 - Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List

## Problem  
- [LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-twin-sum-of-a-linked-list/)

## My Solution

### Code
- [solution.php](./solution.php)
- We use a two-pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list.
- Then, we reverse the second half of the linked list.
- Finally, we calculate the maximum twin sum by iterating through both halves of the list.

### Time & Space Complexity
- Time  : $O(n)$
- Space : $O(n)$
