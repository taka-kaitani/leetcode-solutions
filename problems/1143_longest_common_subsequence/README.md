## My Solution

### Code
- [solution.php](./solution.php)
- [solution.ts](./solution.ts)
- We use dynamic programming approach to calculate the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two strings.

### Time & Space Complexity
- Time  : $O(m \times n)$
  - $m$ : length of `text1`
  - $n$ : length of `text2`
- Space : $O(m \times n)$
