/**
 * # Approach
 * - Use a binary search to minimize the capacity of ship
 *   to carry all of `weights` within `days` days.
 * - When start the binary search,
 *   - Left boundary: maximum weight
 *   - Right boundary: (maximum weight) Ã— (average count of weight per day)
 * - For each step, compute the days spent with capacity `mid`
 *   by using a helper function `daysSpent`.
 * 
 * # Complexity
 * Where n is the length of `weight`;
 * - Time:  O(n log(sum(weight)))
 *   - O(n) to find the maximum weight
 *   - O(log(sum(weight))) for binary search
 *   - O(n) for each calling `daysSpent()`
 * - Space: O(n) for `...weight`
