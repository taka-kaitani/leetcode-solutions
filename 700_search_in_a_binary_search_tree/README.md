## Problem  
- [LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/)

## My Solution

### Code
- [solution.php](./solution.php)
- Leverage the BST property.
- This allows us to avoid searching unnecessary parts of the tree (unlike a full DFS).

### Time & Space Complexity
- Time  : O(h)
- Space : O(h)
- h is the height of the tree.
